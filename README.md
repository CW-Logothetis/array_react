# MethodMinder: flashcards with an LLM

In these days of copy/paste and LLMs, it's easy to forget methods. And I wonder what it's like for beginners who must be tempted just to pseudocode with chatGPT. Maybe that's how things'll end up, with engineers spending much more time on design decisions [https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-generator]. 
Still, we're not there yet, and I'd like a way to revise individual methods themselves when I've a few spare minutes, when I don't have time for CodeWards or Leetcode.
So this is designed to help users learn and memorise JavaScript array methods using a pared down version of Anki's early spaced repetition system. 
The app uses OpenAI to generate content for each array method and allows users to score their recall, which then determines the intervals in the review schedule.
In the near future, I should store the explanations and syntax and just have the LLM generate exercises, to save on cost.
And if I ever have the time, I'll add objects, strings, Promises, syntax, some web APIs...

## Features

- **Spaced Repetition System**: Implements a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize memory retention.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Uses OpenAI to generate explanations, syntax, examples, and exercises for each array method.
- **Interactive Learning**: Users can score their recall of each method as "Again", "Hard", "Good", or "Easy", which adjusts the review schedule.
- **All method page**: Users can see a simple breakdown of the different array methods - like a stripped down version of MDN docs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CW-Logothetis/methodMinder.git
    cd array_openAI
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API Key**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your own OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
      ```env
      VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
      ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

# React + Vite

React in this project works in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It uses [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

## Usage

1. **Home Page**: Displays an overview of the decks (currently just one JavaScript array methods deck) and statistics for new, learning and due today cards.
2. **Deck Summary**: Shows detailed statistics for the selected deck and a "Study" button to start a study session.
3. **Study Page**: Displays the content for the current array method, generated by OpenAI, and allows users to score their recall.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **assets**: images
  - **lib**
    - **components**: React components.
    - **css**
  - **pages**: Pages, comprised of components.
  - **styles**: global css.
  - **utils**: Helper functions.
  - **App.js**: Main application component.
  - **index.js**: Entry point for the React application.
  - **config etc**: env, lint, git, README, packages and config
